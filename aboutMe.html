    <h3>
        Hello my name is Jack. I am currently taking Computer Science Foundations and I love to code but, my first thoughts about coding started when I was little.
        I used to play a lot of video games which made me think about what goes on behind the scenes. I then took Into to Computer Science in my Freshman year of 
        high school to see what I have always only thought about becuase of video games. I was immediately hooked and fell in love with coding and all the nuances of coding.
        I then thought about my career since, I now knew that I wanted to code. I turned to Cyber Security. I thought about the great I could 
        do by being a Cyber Security major. I knew from that college research session that I could continue on my passion of coding by being a 
        Cyber Security major. I have built up my skills from the 2 years that I have been coding and I know how to make a multipage static website and a mobile first designed website. 
        I am not only a coder but a swimmer for the Woodland Regional High School Swim & Dive team. I am involved with Student Council since I am the Vice President for 
        the class of 2025, 2 years in a row. I also play chess and am currently rated 750 in rapids.
